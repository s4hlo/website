# Three.js 3D World Implementation

## Overview
Implementation of a Three.js 3D world with basic controls, environment, and performance monitoring for the portfolio project.

## Current Status
**Phase 1-2 Complete** - Basic 3D world foundation implemented

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Components
- **World3D**: Main 3D canvas component with responsive design
- **Environment**: Basic lighting and sky system
- **Terrain**: Simple ground plane and decorative objects
- **PlayerController**: WASD movement and mouse look (ready for integration)
- **PerformanceMonitor**: Real-time FPS and memory tracking

### ✅ Basic 3D Scene
- Responsive Three.js Canvas
- Ambient and directional lighting
- Test cube and ground plane
- Orbit controls for development
- Performance statistics display

### ✅ User Interface
- Dedicated 3D World page (`/3d-world`)
- Navigation bar integration
- Control instructions overlay
- Performance monitoring panel
- Responsive Material-UI design

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- `three` - Core Three.js library
- `@react-three/fiber` - React renderer for Three.js
- `@react-three/drei` - Useful helpers and controls
- `@types/three` - TypeScript definitions

### Key Features
1. **Responsive Canvas**: Automatically adjusts to viewport
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time FPS and memory tracking
3. **Modular Architecture**: Separate components for different aspects
4. **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety and IntelliSense
5. **Material-UI Integration**: Consistent with portfolio design

## Usage

### Navigation
- Access via `/3d-world` route
- Added to main navigation bar
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### Controls
- **Mouse**: Look around (when pointer locked)
- **WASD**: Movement (when player controller active)
- **Space**: Jump (when player controller active)
- **ESC**: Unlock mouse pointer

### Performance
- Real-time FPS monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- Automatic quality adjustment (planned)
- Performance status indicators

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Player Control System
- [ ] Integrate PlayerController with World3D
- [ ] Implement pointer lock for first-person view
- [ ] Add collision detection
- [ ] Test movement responsiveness

### Phase 4: Enhanced World Features
- [ ] Implement heightmap terrain
- [ ] Add more world objects
- [ ] Enhance lighting system
- [ ] Add post-processing effects

### Phase 5: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement LOD system
- [ ] Add frustum culling
- [ ] Optimize rendering pipeline
- [ ] Mobile device optimization

## Testing

### Current Test Scene
- Orange cube at origin
- Green ground plane
- Basic lighting setup
- Orbit controls for development

### Performance Targets
- **Target FPS**: 60fps
- **Minimum FPS**: 30fps
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor and optimize
- **Loading Time**: < 3 seconds

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+
- WebGL 2.0 support required

## Development Notes

### Code Quality
